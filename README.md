# Image-Steganography
This project explores the integration of steganography to conceal textual data within images, enhancing the security of data transfer.

# Steganography Algorithm
Utilized a custom steganography algorithm for encoding and decoding textual data within the image. The algorithm employs a mapping technique for enhanced security. Least Significant Bit (LSB) algorithm is a common technique in image steganography where the least significant bit of each pixel's color channel (typically red, green, and blue in an RGB image) is replaced with a bit of the hidden message.
